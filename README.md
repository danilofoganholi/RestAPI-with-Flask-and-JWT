# RestAPI-with-Flask-and-JWT
In this project i made a simple REST API using python. I learned how do it with Danilo Moreira in a course of Udemy.

In this project i lerned more about 'RESOURCES' in python and how to work with flask to build a API restuful.

I contructed a simple API of hotels. We can do a GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for hotels and make a search with filters, also is possible to make a login/logout/register for an user, the user will have a token for access, and if he/she wants to delete/put/post something ,he/she must needed to be logged in the sistem. 

With TWT is so easy to create a API connect with a db, in this case I used de SQlite3, just because it is alredy installed in python 3.8. 

All project was built inside of a virtualenv.
